              At Forex Express, we all come to work everyday because we want to solve the biggest problem forex trading is facing in Uganda.
              People do not have access to the most current rates provided by the various Forex Bureaus in Uganda.

              Throughout the History of Forex Trading, people have been incovenienced by these ever changing Forex Rates especially those 
              that are written on billboards (For those with zero access to the Online Rates).
              <br><br>
